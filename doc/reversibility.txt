Reversibility of RUT machines: definition and testing
-----------------------------------------------------

(see rut.txt for a description of RUT machines instructions)

A configuration of a RUT machine is:
  - a coloring of a bi-infinite tape by letters;
  - the location of the head (on which cell of the tape it is);
  - the current state of the head.

A RUT machine m is reversible if there exists a RUT machine m' with
the same set of letters and the same set of states such that starting
from any configuration c, making one step of m then one step of m',
leads back to the initial configuration c.

This kind of step by step reversibility can be checked efficiently
directly on the machine description.

The reverse of a movement instruction [s. ->, s'] has to be [s'. <-, s].

The reverse of a matching case [s. a:b, s'] has to be [s'. b:a, s].

To test reversibility, it is sufficient to reverse each instruction,
combine matching cases into matching instructions and check that
there is no collision of instructions.
